 * Class for the logistic loss function:

 *
 *  - \theta is the vector of estimated coefficient weights for the data features
 *  - (y_i, x_i, o_i, w_i) are the tuple (label, features, offset, weight) of the i'th labeled data point

 *
 *    y_i \in {0, 1}.
 *
 * However, the code below would also work when:
 *
 *    y_i \in {-1, 1}.
