/**
 * Implements the Mat√©rn 5/2 covariance kernel.
 *
 * The Matern kernel is a generalization of the RBF kernel with an additional parameter $\nu$ that allows controlling
 * smoothness. At $\nu = \infty$, the Matern kernel is equivalent to RBF. At $\nu = 0.5$, it's equivalent to the
 * absolute exponential kernel. It's noted in the literature that $\nu = 2.5$ allows the kernel to closely approximate
 * hyperparameter spaces where the smoothness of RBF causes issues (see PBO). Here we hard-code to the 5/2 value because
 * the computation is much simpler than allowing a user-defined $\nu$.
 *
 *     $K(x,x') = \big(\sqrt{5r^2(x,x')} + \frac{5}{3} r^2(x,x') + 1\big) \exp(-\sqrt{5r^2(x,x')})$
 *
 * Where $r(x,x')$ is the Euclidean distance between $x$ and $x'$.
